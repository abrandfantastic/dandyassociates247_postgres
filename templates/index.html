          <p>Are you new to being a Theatrical Angel?</p>
            <p></p>
          <p class="mb-0">We welcome individuals, groups and organisations interested in supporting and investing in our theatre productions and projects.  It can be fun to be the part owner of a production and see how your production performs.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mb-0">     If you are interested in investing in forthcoming Dandy productions or projects please contact us at enquiries@dandyassociates.com</p>
                Commercial plays and musicals are generally financed as standalone projects and often have their own allocated bank account to ensure all funds are dedicated solely to that project. The producer of each production will calculate the estimated costs to put on the production, e.g. creative team fees, actors fees for rehearsals, set design and building, etc. The producer also calculates the estimated weekly running costs, e.g. actors’ salaries, theatre rent, ongoing marketing and publicity fees. Once these budgets are created, the producer can establish what funds are needed for the production (capitalisation). This amount will be set to ensure there is sufficient to pay the production costs including a contingency.
            <p></p>
            <p>The capitalisation for a production is provided by investors (sometimes called ‘Angels’) who each invest a fixed amount of capital in the production and whose liability is set at this amount. The investors receive their capital back from the first profits of the production once running costs, VAT etc have been taken into account. Once all the capital has been re-paid and the production is in profit the investors share 60% of the profits and the producers retain the remaining 40% of the profit. The capitalisation for a production is usually broken down into units which can be bought by investors. The smallest investment unit accepted can be as low as £3,500 and often investors will purchase multiple units.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Theatre investment is very high risk and investors can lose their money. However, on a successful production it can be profitable. Subject to the level of investment made, investors can really feel like part of the production; receiving tickets to previews, press nights or gala performances and meeting the cast on these occasions, receiving invitations to first night parties, and most importantly receiving regular updates on how the show is performing financially and seeing their investment returned on successful productions. It can be fun to see how your production performs and be the part owner of a commercial production</p>
